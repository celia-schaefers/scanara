Scanara AI helps developers and organizations quickly determine if their app or project is HIPAA compliant. Users can check their codebase 3 ways:
* Connecting a GitHub repo in the web app
* Using the VS Code extension
* Installing the npm package

The app scans the project, detects missing security elements, and generates a detailed compliance report highlighting violations, missing safeguards, and recommended fixes — giving teams a clear path to HIPAA alignment.
